### BIAB

It seems that since I don't use as much water as BIAB requires generally, I might have less pH problems. But what does it mean to have full volume? Doesn't it screw up the pH?

* https://pricelessbrewing.github.io/methods/Efficiency/ (lots' of calculators, very nice!)
* Maybe I should a 20 litters mash, then add little water to mash out?
* After your mash. you need to give things a good stir, and keep on stirring while you add heat and bring the whole mash up to Mash Out temp. In traditional brewing mash out isn't really necessary, but in BIAB its really quite important for efficiency. You can skip it, but you will probably lose close to 5 points of efficiency  (168f/75.5556C)

* Cover kettle with sleeping bag - (maybe I should do the same thing for full volume, or create an isolant)
* Note how fastferment allows me to loose less wort by being able to get directly from fermenter to bottles. Only problem might be sediments on the side of the fermentor.

## Yeast is Clogging FastFerment's Ball Valve

I changed the yeast collection recipient a first time, but the yeast is stuck in the fermenter's neck and the collection recipient doesn't fill up. Reading about this everyone was suggesting to use any stick to help unclog it. However, reading those forums I endup reading also about how there:<blockquote>are patches of trub hanging on the sides of the conical. As it drains into the keg patches of trub flow into the keg.</blockquote>Some people were suggesting to filter the wort:

## Tips

* Fine milled grain (almost to flour) [this](http://www.beersmith.com/forum/index.php?topic=11026.msg45014#msg45014), 
* Bulk Sparge: https://byo.com/color/item/403-bulk-up-your-sparge-technique What's good with this, it really explains that I should put a good quantity of water so that we don't have the "Channeling" effect when pourring a little amount.
* Recirculate? Not sure, I'll have to try but same receipe with and without. (Not sure I want a pump that I'll have to clean
* https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/12717/sparging-with-biab
* Prepare for hot break: spray bottle filled with cold water in hand to control the foam over ([from this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=148179)
## NOTES

* I warmed up 11L (approx) of water to 75 degrees (should probably check how hot exactly it should be), and then added it to the kettle so that the kettle was almost full. Note that the temperature was a bit higher than 75C. Stirred for 2 or 3 minutes then drained it. Maybe I should have left it there for 10 minutes.
* TODO: use other fermenter to see how much liquid contains the kettle
* To get the wort to boil, please stir a bit the wort, it's gonna help?
* I started to oxigen the wort directly when trying to chill it, to save some time.
* I can't do the real BIAB "no sparge" because my kettle simply doesn't have the full volume.

# Prepare Kettle

(from SS [Brewtech website](https://ssbrewtech.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001115466-Standard-Kettle-Quick-Start-Guide)

## Summary

* Get Tri-Sodium Phosphate + PBW 
* Protect BIAB grain bag from thermometer probe

## Instructions

* Pre-Clean: Prior to first time use, thoroughly wash all surfaces of the kettle, including the valve and fittings, with Tri-Sodium Phosphate (TSP) in hot water, mixed to the manufacturer's recommendations. Scrub with a soft terry cloth, and after the initial TSP wash, rinse thoroughly and dry all surfaces. 
* Passivation: It's good practice to periodically passivate all stainless steel equipment with an acid based solution to establish a uniform passive oxide layer that will maximize corrosion resistance. Following the pre-clean step, fill the kettle with Star San at a concentration of 1 ounce per gallon at 70-80F for 30 minutes. Moving forward, for best stainless performance, passivation should be performed at least once a year or anytime you believe you may have inadvertently scratched the surface.
* Cleaning and Sanitizing: As part of a regular cleaning regimen both pre and post-boil/mash, wash the interior surfaces of your kettle with an alkali cleaner such as PBW at a ratio of 0.75 ounce per gallon.
