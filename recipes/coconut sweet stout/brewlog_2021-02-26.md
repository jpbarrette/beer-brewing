American Rye Stout
================

This is the [third iteration](./brewlog_2018-10-19.md) of [Zymurgy
Magazine’s Stout
Trousers](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/stout-trousers/).
However, this time around the recipe is highly modified (to a point
where it doesn’t bear any resemblance) to become an American Rye Stout.
This recipe was built and adjusted with [Brewer’s Friend
website](https://www.brewersfriend.com/homebrew/recipe/view/895830/american-rye-stout).
The water profile adjustment by reading Michael Tonsmeire’s [Oatmeal
Coffee Stout
\#3](https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2013/01/oatmeal-cofee-stout-3-bigger-and-bolder.html)
recipe.

The first recipe had a thin mouthfeel. To remedy that I decided to
confirm a tendency this recipe had, meaning using rye as a “body
builder”.

I simplified the recipe (rounder quantities) and I lowered down the IBU
so that it’s calculated as 30 minutes boil, but IBU will be higher
because of the nochill method (calculate 40 minutes as mentionned
below).

# Recipe Changes

  - In this batch, I’ll use starsan in the jerry can before putting the
    hop. This way, I’ll just put the jerry can right away in the river
    to cool down (and not fear infection).
