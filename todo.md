    (that’s why we don’t add all water)

### BIAB

It seems that since I don’t use as much water as BIAB requires
generally, I might have less pH problems. But what does it mean to have
full volume? Doesn’t it screw up the
    pH?

  - Maybe I should a 20 litters mash, then add little water to mash out?
  - After your mash. you need to give things a good stir, and keep on
    stirring while you add heat and bring the whole mash up to Mash Out
    temp. In traditional brewing mash out isn’t really necessary, but in
    BIAB its really quite important for efficiency. You can skip it, but
    you will probably lose close to 5 points of efficiency

  - Cover kettle with sleeping bag - (maybe I should do the same thing
    for full volume, or create an isolant)

  - Note how fastferment allows me to loose less wort by being able to
    get directly from fermenter to bottles. Only problem might be
    sediments on the side of the fermentor.

## Yeast is Clogging FastFerment’s Ball Valve

I changed the yeast collection recipient a first time, but the yeast is
stuck in the fermenter’s neck and the collection recipient doesn’t fill
up. Reading about this everyone was suggesting to use any stick to help
unclog it. However, reading those forums I endup reading also about how
there:

<blockquote>

are patches of trub hanging on the sides of the conical. As it drains
into the keg patches of trub flow into the keg.

</blockquote>

Some people were suggesting to filter the wort:

## Tips

  - Fine milled grain (almost to flour)
    [this](http://www.beersmith.com/forum/index.php?topic=11026.msg45014#msg45014),

  - Bulk Sparge:
    <https://byo.com/color/item/403-bulk-up-your-sparge-technique>
    What’s good with this, it really explains that I should put a good
    quantity of water so that we don’t have the “Channeling” effect when
    pourring a little amount.

  - Recirculate? Not sure, I’ll have to try but same receipe with and
    without. (Not sure I want a pump that I’ll have to
    clean

  - <https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/12717/sparging-with-biab>

  - Prepare for hot break: spray bottle filled with cold water in hand
    to control the foam over ([from
    this](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/showthread.php?t=148179) \#\#
    NOTES

  - I warmed up 11L (approx) of water to 75 degrees (should probably
    check how hot exactly it should be), and then added it to the kettle
    so that the kettle was almost full. Note that the temperature was a
    bit higher than 75C. Stirred for 2 or 3 minutes then drained it.
    Maybe I should have left it there for 10 minutes.

  - TODO: use other fermenter to see how much liquid contains the kettle

  - To get the wort to boil, please stir a bit the wort, it’s gonna
    help?

  - I started to oxigen the wort directly when trying to chill it, to
    save some time.

  - I can’t do the real BIAB “no sparge” because my kettle simply
    doesn’t have the full volume.
